        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Our Story </h3>
        <p>A  group of young African book lovers accidentally met at a dinner party five years ago.The meeting gave birth to one of the greatest ideas ever.They felt the need to create a place where anyone from anywhere can get access to some amazing content.And in the process,discover events and places,by not neccesarily being there physically,but by merely reading words from a page.They clearly didn’t plan on wasting the amazing idea because they immediately embarked on creating a website famously known as ‘African Books’ where people could get a wide variety of books by talented African authors.</p>
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Led by our passion for books we go miles to find books from every corner of Africa,and make them available to our readers  in just a click of a link.
            We just dont have two or twenty books for you,we instead have books that might take you a whole lifetime to read.
            Our unlimited supply of books will  deny  boredom access to your life ever again. </p> 
        <h3>Founders</h3>
        <p>This four individuals are the ones responsible for getting African Bokks to what where it is today.They took it from just an idea to an entity.They took the risks and are now taking the reward of creating something wonderful and beneficial to the society in general</p>
