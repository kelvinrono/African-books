        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>A  group of young African book lovers accidentally met at a dinner party five years ago.The meeting gave birth to one of the greatest ideas ever.They felt the need to create a place where anyone from anywhere can get access to some amazing content.And in the process,discover events and places,by not neccesarily being there physically,but by merely reading words from a page.They clearly didn’t plan on wasting the amazing idea because they immediately embarked on creating a website famously known as ‘African Books’ where people could get a wide variety of books by talented African authors.</p>
