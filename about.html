        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Our Story </h3>
        <p>A  group of young African book lovers accidentally met at a dinner party five years ago.The meeting gave birth to one of the greatest ideas ever.They felt the need to create a place where anyone from anywhere can get access to some amazing content.And in the process,discover events and places,by not neccesarily being there physically,but by merely reading words from a page.They clearly didn’t plan on wasting the amazing idea because they immediately embarked on creating a website famously known as ‘African Books’ where people could get a wide variety of books by talented African authors.</p>
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Led by our passion for books we go miles to find books from every corner of Africa,and make them available to our readers  in just a click of a link.
            We just dont have two or twenty books for you,we instead have books that might take you a whole lifetime to read.
            Our unlimited supply of books will  deny  boredom access to your life ever again. </p>
